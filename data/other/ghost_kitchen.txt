Ghost kitchen
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigationJump to search
A ghost kitchen (also known as a delivery-only restaurant, virtual kitchen, shadow kitchen, commissary kitchen, cloud kitchen or dark kitchen) is a professional food preparation and cooking facility set up for the preparation of delivery-only meals. Some ghost kitchens have allowed takeout meals or included drive-throughs. They do not include a storefront or indoor seating for customers. A ghost kitchen differs from a virtual restaurant in that a ghost kitchen is not a restaurant brand in itself and may contain kitchen space and facilities for more than one restaurant brand.[citation needed] Ghost kitchens can work within brick-and-mortar restaurants or function as standalone facilities.

History
The term “Ghost Kitchen” was first used in a 2015 NBC New York article. The article was critical of ghost kitchens in New York City, where restaurant owners were caught by an investigative team listing their restaurant under multiple different brands on delivery applications such as Seamless and GrubHub. These kitchens had names and addresses that failed to match any listing on the city’s database of restaurant inspection grades. Several of these locations were non-retail food processing establishments, which did not have restaurant permits to sell food directly to customers. Consequently, the virtual brands were taken off of Seamless and GrubHub and each company passed policies to fact-check restaurant information and give transparency to customers using the delivery applications.[1]

Ghost kitchens have emerged as a business model in response to the rapid growth in consumer demand for restaurant delivery meals,[2] the rising usage of third-party delivery applications, and the lower costs incurred by using kitchen facilities located outside of high-rent, high-foot-trafficked urban locations.[3][4] Using a ghost kitchen allows established restaurants with dining-in service to expand their delivery operations without adding stress to the existing kitchen, frees up parking taken by the delivery vehicles, and allows restaurant to enter new areas with lower costs.[5] Ghost kitchens have been crucial for the food service industry because they allow restaurants to operate at lower costs and keep pace with the growing demand for food delivery.

Function
A ghost kitchen prepares meals for a restaurant or virtual restaurant to then be picked up for delivery, takeout, or given at a drive-through.[citation needed]

Ghost kitchens offer a multitude of benefits compared to their brick-and-mortar counterparts. The lack of customer seating and dining areas saves money by reducing the square footage of the facility, lowering the rent.[6] The physical location matters less, so ghost kitchens can set up in cheaper areas without having to worry about losing out to competition in more convenient locations. Additionally, there is no need to hire a wait staff to serve customers or maintain the would-be seating area.[7] Other eliminated expenses include front-of-house staff, renovations, and paper menus. Optimized delivery and increased kitchen space in a ghost kitchen contribute to lower labor costs as well. Whereas a typical restaurant delivers 15 to 20 orders per hour, a ghost kitchen can deliver 60 orders per hour with a single employee.[8] The reduced space lowers overall overhead and operational costs, thus yielding higher profit margins without reducing the price of the food provided.[9]

The lack of a physical brand allows companies to experiment with new menus, brands, and concepts with ease and low-risk. Menus can be adjusted to match current trends or target multiple demographics with a variety of cuisines.[10] The online nature of ghost kitchens makes it possible for virtual restaurants to easily track customer data and analytics through the food ordering process and make data-driven decisions. They can track the popularity of items, wait times, and customer feedback via ratings and adjust their menus accordingly.[11]

An individual can set up a ghost kitchen to start their own brand, which is identified with their own online restaurant. One might choose to start up a ghost kitchen because setup costs are lower, and the time taken is shorter, than for a kitchen that also serves a walk-in restaurant. It might take only 3 or 4 weeks.[citation needed]

Growth from the COVID-19 pandemic
Many brick-and-mortar restaurants limited dining on their property or shut down entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and government restrictions.[12] Ghost kitchens helped brick-and-mortar restaurants recoup their losses and minimize employee layoffs by allowing them to prepare food for multiple brands and keep themselves in business.[13] Ghost kitchens kept many restaurants in business during the pandemic when they would otherwise have to close down by lowering costs and allowing them to work with delivery services. While the brick-and-mortar restaurants survived, virtual brands profilerated and operated at low cost by using their facilities as ghost kitchens, and food delivery companies prospered because of the boom in demand caused by restricted indoor dining.

The COVID-19 Pandemic accelerated the growth of the ghost kitchen industry by five years within three months in 2020. Many restaurants survive due to ghost kitchens and the food delivery options they make available. This spike in growth is predicted to potentially create a $1 trillion dollar industry by 2030. [14]

Impact on the Food Service Industry
Across the world, the food delivery industry is increasing at a high rate. Ghost kitchens have proliferated to match the increased demand of food delivery services. The expansion of ghost kitchens, in turn, led to growth in both the food delivery and restaurant industries.

In the United States, food delivery applications produce $35 billion in annual revenue, and are projected to grow to $42 billion in annual revenue by 2025, with 111 million users. As of 2020, there were 1,500 ghost kitchens in the United States. The United States restaurant industry is about $800 billion.[15]

In Europe, food delivery applications produce over $18.9 billion in revenue annually, and are projected to grow to $29.1 billion by 2025, with 150 million users.[16]

In China, food delivery applications produce $51.5 billion in revenue annually, and are projected to grow to $100 billion by 2025, with 650 million users. As of 2020, there were 7,500 ghost kitchens in China. [17]

Globally, food delivery applications produce $120 billion in revenue annually, and are projected to grow to $230 billion by 2025.[18]
