It was helpful to have a detailed understanding of the design wishes. A video of how to write it is also included, so even I, who is not good at English, seems to have no problem. If you have another chance, please.

I had you design by incorporating what I wanted in terms of nuance into the sign. I am looking forward to writing a sign that is familiar to me, as I was able to respond quickly and flexibly to the shape that was closest to my ideal.

Thank you for making the design very fashionable. I can't design the autograph myself, so I'm really glad that you designed it this time. There was also a practice paper, so it was easy to practice. After all, it was great because it had a video and the stroke order was easy to understand!

 Since I started working as a musician, I asked for my own autograph. After listening carefully to the consultation, I was able to propose a wonderful item that conveys an atmosphere that is easy to write even for myself, who is not good at writing, and I made a very favorite item. Videos and kits for practice are also kind. I think I'll love writing names. Thank you very much.

 I was asked for the first time, but I am grateful that I was able to meet creators that I would not normally be able to meet, made a special sign only for me, and had an exciting and wonderful time including exchanges. I will. I'm really thankful to you. If you have another chance, thank you.

I asked him to make a design that could be used for a long time in order to put his autograph on the picture. I am not accustomed to the alphabet cursive, and when I made a design proposal so that I could understand which characters were arranged where, I was happy to receive the work of inserting a character delimiter line, which was very helpful. At the time of delivery, I am very happy that a video of what I am writing and a practice kit are also included. Now you can practice many times in advance.

Of course, the work was satisfactory, but I was relieved and learned from the details such as the exchanges in the process and the announcement when there was a time lag in the next reply. Thank you very much!

Thank you very much for your kindness. Also, he suggested a very good sign for the finished product. (I think it's very nice to be able to choose from multiple) And the video is also included, so it will be helpful. I want to practice and make this sign my own. Thank you very much.
